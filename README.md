# NASA-APOD
A script that will automatically update your desktop background to NASA's astronomy picture of the day.

 The script makes use of NASA's api to get the image so you will have to get an API key from NASA's website (it's free!).
 
 The scripts takes one parameter, the API key. So if you are running the script from the command line do something like the following: 
 
 pythonExePath     scriptPath     --apiKey YOUR_INDIVIDUAL_API_KEY
 
 You can run this script from a batch file and set it to run when your system starts up so it will automatically update every day when you turn on your machine.
 
 You may need to play with your screen settings so the image fits to your screen.
